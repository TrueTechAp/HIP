## Previous shipments

Our CE Certificates are ready. We await approval from the FCC. Our target markets are Europe, Middle East and America.

## Customer Support

Support will be provided via e-mail, support request page on our Site and Live Chat. General troubleshooting will be posted on our website. We aim to respond to inquiries within 1 business day. We plan to receive support requests that can be resolved quickly via Live Chat and resolve them within the same day. We will receive and respond to support requests in accordance with our company SLA standards

For emergency level: 	Same Day
For intermediate level: 	12 -24 Hours
For low level: 		36 – 48 Hours

On our website, we will provide clear information about the production status and expected batches of our product. The ordering process of our first product will collect the payment details at the time of pre-order, but we will only charge the payment method just before shipping the devices. We will limit pre-orders to the batches we plan. Our customers will be able to follow the processes of the product they have ordered from the customer portal we will give them. 2-year warranty will be provided for our TAP 50 and TAP 90 models.

## Hardware Security

Our gateway has an RJGT102WDP8 encryption chip which is originally used for intellectual property protection.
•	It integrates 176-byte EEPROM, 128-byte registers, 8-byte key, 8-byte user-id/serial number and 16-byte control information.
•	It uses the SHA-256 Encryption-Authentication Algorithm, supports configurable watchdog timer, outputs reset control signals, and can also communicate with MCU through I²C serial interface.
•	It also supports the low-power mode.
RJGT102WDP8 is very secure as it has a high-performance integrated circuit used for copy protection. It adopts the SHA-256 encryption algorithm and has disposable programmable units. On top of that, the registers allow writing user-customized EEPROM units. It is pin-to-pin with ECC508A and can be used to store the swarm keys issued by Helium.
The sharing of prototype for adult result could be further discussed and arranged.

## Manufacturing Information

As a DGR Project, we use our devices and software that we have produced in our own R&D in Turkey and the countries we export to. Our own production and software are mainly in Smart City Applications; smart irrigation systems, smart lighting systems, smart wi-fi, garbage collection - monitoring systems, for Production and Logistics Sector; For autonomous vehicle, Digital factory and dark warehouse services, Industry 4.0, Quality control with image processing, debugging and occupational health projects, Payment and Transition Applications; We have implemented foreign currency exchange machines, Parking lot access systems, Cafeteria automation systems, Waste collection vending machines, Payment Systems, Hotel Fraud prevention systems and digitization Digitalization Applications. We have completed many projects in the Middle East and Arab countries, which are our target markets, and we are expanding our ecosystem with ongoing projects. We have a good software and hardware team and we are implementing many projects with our team.

## Proof of Identity

Separately submitted to DeWi.

## Budget & Capital

We have enough funds available to produce large volumes. This is eased by the fact that we don't have to manufacture a custom hardware platform.

## Risks & Challenges

We have identified a number of risks and challenges:
•	The readily available components come from different manufacturers causing potential supply-chain challenges
•	While we have experience producing and shipping devices, TAP50, TAP90 may require us to scale-up to meet demand.
•	We are used to building and developing solutions for corporates and professionals, selling directly to consumers, and giving support to consumers of different skill level is new to us.
